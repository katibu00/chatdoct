                            <p>Chatdoc is a social enterprise that helps underserviced communities in Nigeria to access qualitative healthcare virtually through Telemedicine
                                Telemedicine is simply the process of delivering healthcare services to patient virtually when the doctor and the patient are not in the same physical space. The World Health Organisation (WHO) describes it as ‘The delivery of health care services, where distance is a critical factor, by all health care professionals using information and communication technologies for the exchange of valid information for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease and injuries, research and evaluation, and for the continuing education of health care providers, all in the interests of advancing the health of individuals and their communities’
                                Health crisis has been a major problem affecting Nigerians for decades. Although the country has population of about 200million people, there are inadequate human resources for health to meet up the healthcare demand of the population. The Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) reported that, out of about 80,000 registered medical doctors in Nigeria only about 40,000 are currently practicing within the country. This makes the Patient to Doctor Ratio at about 1:5000 short of World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation of 1:600.The effect of this crisis manifest in rural and semi-urban areas, because the few available healthcare personnel are concentrated in major cities.

                            <p>People living in rural and semi-urban areas find it difficult to access qualitative healthcare. As a result, many of them consider a chemist or pharmacy store as primary point of care while some resort to spiritualist, quacks or self-medication. <br/>A group of young  individuals consisting of medical doctors, software engineers and entrepreneurs with diverse experience and passion for healthcare brought Chatdoc as a sustainable solution to this crisis. Chatdoc brings doctors closer to the rural and under-serviced communities virtually. Through chatdoc web application, patients can speak to qualified medical doctors via Chat, Video/Audio Conference and receive e-precription, medical advice or appropriate referral at an affordable cost. 
                                Chatdoc provides care beyond distance, cost and language barriers. Therefore patients can easily login from their phones, or computers, select the type of service based on cost and languages of the healthcare provider and speak with the Doctor.
